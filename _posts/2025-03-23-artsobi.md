Artsobi was held for the first time on 22 March, at the NLB Drama Centre from 1 to 7pm. Attendees were able to participate in an Artsobi Stamp Rally where they could redeem exclusive prizes by exchanging 1 stamp with every $5 spent. The artsobi had a strong art direction and aesthetic displayed on their marketing and promotional materials. I was very excited to table at an event that had a obvious inclination towards artists.

On the day of the event, I arrived at 10 am. Taking the elevator up to the event venue on level 3. I decided to take a selfie. I was cosplaying as Caleb from Love and Deepspace and my phone let out a loud shutter sound. It was especially loud and and made a little boy pipe up asking his mom about the sound. The mother hushed the boy telling him that a “korkor took a selfie”. I was embarrassed and pretended that nothing was wrong as I quickly hurried out of the elevator.

As the venue was not yet ready for artists to set up, I was allowed to leave my belongings at a corner of the hall before leaving to grab breakfast and snacks. I met FuwaFuwaBunny1 at the door and we headed to Bugis Junction together to purchase McDonalds and Liho. After the trip, we promptly began to set up our respective tables and prepare for the event. For this event, I tried a new set up involving a back drop with all my prints and a turntable for my squishy badges. It was difficult to set up the back drop alone and I had also accidentally toppled it on top of my booth neighbor who was behind me. When testing my set up at home, I ultimately decided to add foam to the base in order to make it more stable. The event venue however already had carpet flooring, as a result the stands were not stable on the overly soft base. I had to call over a friend who was setting up at a far corner of the hall to help me hold on to the stands so I could remove the foam underneath.

After finally completing set up, I could pick up my helper of the day, Nori, who was confused by the huge crowd queuing outside the hall and did not dare to enter. I finally touched my food as I briefed her on how my booth works. I was happy to see familiar faces visit my booth again and had a good time chatting with them. I really appreciate friends for always dropping by to visit me at events. The event had super cute mascots that were featured throughout their social media and rally prizes. We took a picture with our artists tags to commemorate the event. Despite the busy event, I was able to find time to walk around and mingle with friends thanks to Nori manning my booth.

I learnt that the event stamp rally was highly successful and there was a long line of people queuing up to redeem the event goods. Before the event ended at 7pm, most of the goods were completely redeemed. After packing up and leaving the venue, I headed over to Suntec and had a sumptuous dinner. We had to wait to be seat for awhile and once the food came, I quickly ate it without taking any photos due to my hunger.
